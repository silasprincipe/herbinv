## Introduction

This project assessed how climate change will impact the distribution of three key species of sea urchins in the Western Atlantic. This was done through SDMs produced using LGCP models under a Bayesian framework. For more details, reader is referred to the publication "A thorny future for sea urchins in the Tropical Western Atlantic" (under review). All codes and data used in the study are available in this folder, except original climatic layers, which are available online.
